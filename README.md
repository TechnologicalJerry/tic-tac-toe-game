# tic-tac-toe-game

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with a variety of modern web technologies, allowing users to play in their preferred frontend framework and leveraging a robust backend for potential future enhancements.

## Tech Stack

This project showcases implementations of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using the following technologies:

**Frontend:**

* **Angular 19:** A comprehensive platform for building complex single-page applications.
* **React 19 + Next.js 15:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces with server-side rendering and routing capabilities.
* **Nuxt.js:** An intuitive and powerful framework built on top of Vue.js for creating universal web applications.

**Backend:**

* **NestJS:** A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
* **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

**Databases (for potential future features like user accounts, game history, etc.):**

* **MySQL:** A widely used open-source relational database management system.
* **MongoDB:** A cross-platform document-oriented database program classified as a NoSQL database.
* **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system known for its reliability and data integrity.

**Additional Technologies:**

* **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and developer productivity (primarily used with Angular and NestJS).
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** The core language for React, Next.js, and Express.js.
* **HTML5:** The standard markup language for creating web pages.
* **CSS3:** The latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language for styling web pages.
* **npm** or **yarn** or **pnpm:** Package managers for JavaScript dependencies.
* **Git:** Distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code.
* **GitHub:** A web-based platform for version control using Git.

## Project Structure (Conceptual)

Each frontend framework (Angular, React/Next.js, Nuxt.js) will likely reside in its own directory within the repository. Similarly, the backend implementations (NestJS, Express.js) might be organized separately.

## Getting Started

To run each specific implementation, navigate to its respective directory and follow the instructions provided in its own README file (which would be created within each subdirectory). Generally, you can expect the following steps:

**Frontend (Angular, React/Next.js, Nuxt.js):**

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd angular  # or cd react-nextjs or cd nuxtjs
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    * **Angular:** `ng serve -o`
    * **React/Next.js:** `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev`
    * **Nuxt.js:** `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev`

**Backend (NestJS, Express.js):**

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd nestjs  # or cd expressjs
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    * **NestJS:** `npm run start:dev` or `yarn start:dev` or `pnpm start:dev`
    * **Express.js:** `npm run dev` or `nodemon index.js` (assuming your main file is `index.js` and you have `nodemon` installed globally or as a dev dependency)

## Features

Each implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game will include the core functionality:

* Two-player gameplay on a 3x3 grid.
* Alternating turns for 'X' and 'O' players.
* Detection of winning conditions (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
* Detection of a draw when all squares are filled and no winner is found.
* Clear and intuitive user interface.

Depending on the specific implementation and future development, additional features might include:

* Single-player mode against an AI opponent.
* Online multiplayer functionality.
* User accounts and game history (leveraging the backend and databases).
* Visual customizations and themes.
